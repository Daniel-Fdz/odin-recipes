      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>These baked tomato slices are a simple, healthy, and flavorful side dish or appetizer. Ripe tomatoes are sliced and seasoned with herbs, garlic, olive oil, and a sprinkle of cheese, then baked until tender and slightly caramelized.</p>
      <p>Perfect as a light snack, a topping for toast, or a complement to pasta or grilled meats. Quick to prepare and full of Mediterranean flavor, this dish brings out the natural sweetness of tomatoes in every bite.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients (1 serving)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 medium tomato</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Wash and slice 1 medium tomato into slices about 1/4 inch (0.5 cm) thick. Try to keep the slices even so they bake evenly.</li>
        <li>Line a small baking tray with parchment paper or lightly grease it. Place the tomato slices in a single layer, slightly spaced apart.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil over the slices. Sprinkle with minced garlic (or garlic powder), dried oregano or Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 12–15 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft, slightly shriveled at the edges, and starting to caramelize.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and, if desired, sprinkle with fresh basil or parsley before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
      </ol>
